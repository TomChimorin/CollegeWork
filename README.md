# COLLEGE WORK:
What is college work? Well it's a long rabbit hole of 99.9999% of my projects from college. Sounds fun right? Although, I don't find them that important to be entitled to their own live links. Not that they're a piece of junk or anything.
Just a showcase of my journey in coding through several programming languages.

Below I will be showcasing a few cool websites I've made over the past few years :)

### IceCream Project
Have ideas for imaginative flavors of ice cream? In this project, I display some of the most bizarre but imaginative flavors roaming around in my mind. 
Love playing Lethal Company? There's a place for you too in this website. Go ahead and visit it and you'll see why. Make sure your audio for your browser is enabled. I promise it won't be loud hehe.

### Pink Panther themed To-Do List
Big fan of the OG Pink Panther cartoon? Well here you have a to-do list project based off of pink panther. A collaboration project done with [blekmus](https://www.github.com/blekmus).

### Children's Story Maker
Don't ask me why we were told to make this but here we are. A children's story book maker. Me and my fellow colleague blekmus again created this. Definitely tried not to make it super boring and added funny memey words and pictures.

### AniList API Project
This one was really fun to make. Again a collaboration project with [blekmus](https://www.github.com/blekmus). Some would say I'm obsessed with this blekmus. Who even is this guy? If you're really curious, head on over to his GitHub.
This project was made using the AniList API where we displayed the most popular animes by date with their ratings and many other details by date. 

These are a few of the most fun to make. Definitely will be updating this when I go to UNI.
