            <p>Jvke's 'Golden Hour,' released in July 2022, gained TikTok fame and international success. 
                With semi-rapped verses, modern music references, 
                and a compelling chorus, the song reached top charts worldwide. 
                Billboard praised its winning formula, featuring a racing piano line and Jvke's emotive vocals. 
                Described as a glittery ballad and a slow-burn love song by NME, 
                the Official Charts Company highlighted its tender piano ballad essence with a hip-hop influence. </p>

                <h3>[Verse 1]</h3>
        <p>It was just two lovers</p>
        <p>Sittin' in the car, listenin' to Blonde</p>
        <p>Fallin' for each other</p>
        <p>Pink and orange skies, feelin' super childish</p>
        <p>No Donald Glover</p>
        <p>Missed call from my mother</p>
        <p>Like, "Where you at tonight?"</p>
        <p2>Got no alibi</p2>

        <h3>[Pre-Chorus]</h3>
        <p>I was all alone with the love of my life</p>
        <p>She's got glitter for skin</p>
        <p>My radiant beam in the night</p>
        <p2>I don't need no light to see you</p2>

        <h3>[Chorus]</h3>
        <p>Shine</p>
        <p>It's your golden hour (Oh-oh-oh)</p>
        <p>You slow down time</p>
        <p2>In your golden hour (Oh-oh-oh)</p2>

        <h3>[Verse 2]</h3>
        <p>We were just two lovers</p>
        <p>Feet up on the dash, drivin' nowhere fast</p>
        <p>Burnin' through the summer</p>
        <p>Radio on blast, make the moment last, she got solar power</p>
        <p>Minutes feel like hours</p>
        <p>She knew she was the baddest</p>
        <p2>Can you even imagine fallin' like I did?</p2>
        
        <h3>[Pre-Chorus]</h3>
        <p>For the love of my life</p>
        <p>She's got glow on her face</p>
        <p>A glorious look in her eyes</p>
        <p>My angel of light </p>
        <p>I was all alone with the love of my life</p>
        <p>She's got glitter for skin</p>
        <p>My radiant beam in the night</p>
        <p2>I don't need no light to see you</p2>

        <h3>[Chorus]</h3>
        <p>Shine</p>
        <p>It's your golden hour (Oh-oh-oh)</p>
        <p>You slow down time</p>
        <p2>In your golden hour (Oh-oh-oh)</p2>
